Positioning of marker B

Marker B swould sometime appeares not exactly where the original destination marker is put initially. The B and A markers were removed at the rout planner stage, to make the design better looking, but this causes inaccuracy. Alternative solution could be to force marker B to be exactly at the point of the original marker. Drawback: may need to draw a 'walking' line across unmarked areas and mistakes could arise from that.
