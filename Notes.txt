Notes to discuss


Positioning of endpoint marker

Marker B (endpoint) would sometime appear not exactly where the original destination marker is put initially. The B and A markers were removed at the rout planner stage, to make the design better looking, but this causes an occasional gap between the end of the line and the marker. It would be good to draw a line across the gap but that may sometimes give wrong routs (eg across lake or building).

Eg. from IC, driving mode does not show the rout all the way to the tree (see screenshots). latlong_you = {lat: 51.498867, lng: -0.174457}
