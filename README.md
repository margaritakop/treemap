# Get me to The Tree

A webpage that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to show a route from the user's current location to another fixed location (my favourite tree in Hyde Park). User can switch between walking, driving, and public transportation routes. Walking is set as the default transport mode.

Additional info: The API key embedded in the last script tag in index.html is restricted to be used only from the above website. If you wish to open the page locally, please remove the key (it still works with a warning) or use a different key.
