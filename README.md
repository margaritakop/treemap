# Maps API: Treemap

Create a webpage that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to show a route from the user's current location to another fixed location (which could be anywhere: your favourite restaurant, Buckingham Palace, Google London, etc.) - I chose my favourite spot in Hyde Park. -
Allow the user to switch between walking, driving, and public transportation routes.
Bonus points for making it responsive and work well on small screens (phone, tablets) and with touch interactions.
